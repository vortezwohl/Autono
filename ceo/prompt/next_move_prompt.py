[step1] In the provided history, events related to the user's request are listed chronologically:
    1. Steve calculated the radius of the sphere using the expression "(3 * 174.9 / 15.9 * 2.77)", resulting in a radius of 91.41 cm.
    2. Steve then calculated the surface area of the sphere using the formula "4 * 3.14159 * (91.41^2)", resulting in a surface area of 105001.841348316 cmÂ².
[step2] According to the history, the radius and surface area have been calculated, but the volume calculation and file writing have not been completed, therefore the user request has not been fully and properly accomplished.
[step3] The unfinished parts of the user request are the calculation of the volume and writing the results to 'result.txt'. The abilities I possess include "calculator" for performing calculations and "write_file" for writing content to a file. 
[step4] Since the user's request is not fully accomplished, and I have the ability to calculate the volume and write to a file, my next move is to use the "calculator" ability with the expression "(4/3) * 3.14159 * (91.41^3)" to compute the volume of the sphere.
[step5] This step is not applicable because the user request has not been fully accomplished, and I have the ability to continue progressing.
[step6] This step is not applicable because the user request has not been fully accomplished.
